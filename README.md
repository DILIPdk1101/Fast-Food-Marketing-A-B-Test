# A/B Testing of Marketing Campaigns for New Menu Item

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the effectiveness of three marketing campaigns for promoting a new menu item across multiple store locations. Using A/B testing, the sales performance of each campaign is analyzed to identify the most successful marketing strategy.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to determine which of the three marketing campaigns has the greatest impact on sales performance and whether any statistically significant differences exist between them.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **Python:** Used for statistical analysis, including bootstrapping and hypothesis testing.
- **Confidence Intervals:** To assess the statistical significance of the differences in median sales between the campaigns.
- **Data Analysis:** Employed various data manipulation techniques to clean and prepare sales data for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Created graphs to represent the weekly trends and sales comparisons between the campaigns.

## Key Findings

- **Campaign B:** Consistently underperformed compared to Campaigns A and C, with 10k lower median sales.
- **Campaign A vs. Campaign C:** No statistically significant difference was found between the two, with a median difference of 4.2k (95% CI: [1.6k - 6.7k]).
- **Weekly Trends:** Campaign A showed a stable upward trend in sales, whereas Campaign C showed a downward trend over the four-week period.

## Recommendations

- **Campaign B:** Should be discontinued or substantially revised due to its underperformance.
- **Campaigns A and C:** Both are viable options for broader deployment, but Campaign A showed a slight but consistent advantage in sales, making it the preferred choice.
- **Next Steps:** Continue monitoring sales data for emerging trends and conduct further tests in specific regions or market segments.
